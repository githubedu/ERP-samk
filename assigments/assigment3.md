As an ERP project manager you might face the situation that not all the modules are familiar to you. Choose one of the modules (finance, logistics, production, materials management, project management, human resources) and analyze it in your portfolio:

1. Describe a module you have chosen, what kind of functions are included in this module typically?

2. Which modules are important to link/integrate to your module (that you have chosen) inside company? 

3. What kind of direct integrations can be used with your module outside company? For example subcontractors, clients..

4. Find at least two ERP suppliers', present their commercial module names and find similarities and differencies between these two suppliers' modules.

Report length: file (Word) approx. 900 words or video with presentation approx. 15 min or detailed slide show approx. 12 slides.
