Imagine you are named as a project manager in ERP implementation team. You need to prepare some kind of platform to gather all your reports, so that you can easily share and represent your reports to management team. 

1. Decide if you want to do the project work as a team or individually. Establish your group in Moodle. Please do this whether it is one member team or several (2-4) members. 

2. Introduce your company. It might be a company where you are working at the moment or where you have previously worked. It can also be a company you have searched from the internet or it can be totally creation of your own. Introduce the company in your portfolio. At least state: name, turnover, amount of employees, business idea.

3. Create a way to somehow represent project phases.

4. Create a timeline or tasks showing scheduled works of this course, mention at least group works, SAP workshops and final exam. Place them in correct project phase.

Share the project report/link by 25th September (Sunday) with management team (teachers) by Moodle. If you are sharing a link to your work, please make sure it is available also to users outside SAMK, as co-teacher uses personal account.

Grading system

5 excellent

All points requested in the assignment instructions are carefully and well-structured answered. The schedule of report is respected and the report demonstrates ambitious attitude towards the subject, as well as a diverse and critical use of sources combined with students' own thinking. Portfolio and report are creative and easy to read.

3-4 good, very good

Almost all the points requested in the assignment instructions are clearly answered. The report is carefully constructed and shows elements of studentsâ€™ own thinking. Students' thinking is clearly distinguishable from sources. Portfolio and report are easy to read and shows elements of creativity.

1-2 passable, satisfactory

The report is deficient and/or work-quantitatively clearly undersized, but there are shown some individual elements requested in the assignment instructions. Only the simplest sources are used and students' own thinking do not distinguish itself clearly. The report and portfolio follow the path of least resistance.

0 fail

Some/all assignments are missing from project portfolio.
