### Axelor vs Apache OFBiz
Back to the task of [selecting an open-source ERP system](https://code.33co.de/ehofmann/ERP-samk/issues/19), between six solutions identified, three were selected
- [Axelor](https://axelor.com/erp/)
- [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/)
- [OFBiz](https://ofbiz.apache.org/)
[Axelor] was selected for testing purpose and an instance has been installed in a virtual machine and can be accessed [here](https://erp.33co.de).    

## Comparison methodology
For the purpose of the [assigment 3.4](assigments/assigment3.md)
> 4. Find at least two ERP suppliers', present their commercial module names and find similarities and differencies between these two suppliers' modules.
I will compare based on the user interface, matching similarities and diferences. Assuming that Axelor is the reference ERP system.
