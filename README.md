# ERP Implementation Portfolio, by Eduardo Luis Hofmann


ERP implementation portfolio, for the discipline ERP at Satakunta University of Applied Science. Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a tool for project management. The concept is to group all information in a *folder* storage model. Also, in order to share online the portfolio, I'm using my [self-hosted](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/self-hosting.htm) instance of [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).
More information on how to navigate throught the platform, check this [video](# "video under creation ;)")
