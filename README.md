# ERP Implementation Portfolio, by Eduardo Luis Hofmann


ERP implementation portfolio, for the discipline ERP at Satakunta University of Applied Science. Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as a tool for project management. The concept is to group all information in a *folder* storage model. Also, in order to share online the portfolio, I'm using [code.33co.de](https://code.33co.de/ehofmann/ERP-samk/) that is my [self-hosted](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/self-hosting.htm) instance of [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/).
More information on how to navigate throught the platform, check this [video](video/platformDescription.mp4)

DISCLAIMER: The company Kartano Tech Oy is a real company I founded in 2017 and is still registered in the Registration Office. However, since 2021 the company board has decided pause activities.
